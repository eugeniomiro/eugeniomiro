# Test Driven Development

### TDD Laws

* You can’t write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
* You can’t write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
* You can’t write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.

### TDD Rules

* Don't go for the gold
